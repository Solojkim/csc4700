Whiplash

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Anywhere that there is 0 to no light pollution. Or Machu Pichu.


If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Controlled aging. Because I'd love to live forever but do not want to have to live forever.
